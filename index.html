					<h2>Why do we federate?</h2><img data-src="./images/apollo-logo.webp" height="200">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Hello everyone</p>
						<p>For many of us that joined Rivian within the last 18 months or so you may have come from a background where you haven't used GraphQL before, or you're new to federation</p>
						<p>So first I thought i'd spend some time reminding us why we're using GQL, and more specifically federation.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>The before times</h2>
						<img alt="rest api diagram" data-src="./images/REST.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>We're all familiar with the before times, in our case a collection of micro apps and a series of apis to contact</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Multiple endpoints</li>
								<li>Over-fetching and under-fetching</li>
								<li>Multiple round trips to get hierarchical data</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The monolith</h2>
						<img alt="GQL Monolith diagram" data-src="./images/Monolith.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							<h3>Main advantages of graphql federation</h3>
							<p>So this was the first logical step with GraphQL. We create a graphQL server, giving us a single point of access for our clients</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Single point of access for our clients - simplicity</li>
								<li>Also access multiple data sources/services within the same query</li>
								<li>Introspection provides a central catalogue of all data available</li>
								<li>Simplifies access control into a single place i.e. the gateway</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Not a scalable architecture</li>
								<li>Responsibility for definition and implementation of the graph is hard to divide</li>
								<li>Single point of failure?</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The Supergraph</h2>
						<img alt="Supergraph diagram" data-src="./images/Supergraph.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Pros</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Minimise our implementation costs as graph implementation work isn't duplicated. We can reuse the graphs of other teams</li>
								<li>Separation of concerns, Makes our API "evolvable". We don't have to be all in, and we don't have to do massive v1/v2/v3 api migrations like we do with Rest. </li>
								<li>We can define our own caching strategies to reduce the load on underlying rest apis and optimise how we fetch from those APIs, whilst staying as a single trip experience</li>
								<li>DX - If your developers need to extend what a particular entity can return, That can do it from within their own graph first, rather than waiting for the graph to support it.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>So we're done right, we're doing an awesome job and we're ahead of they curve by adopting GQL federation right?</p>

						<h2>How can we harness this better?</h2>
						<div class="fragment">"Think in graphs"</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<h3>Think in graphs</h3>
							<p>We need to get back to "thinking in graphs", not making our graphs "REST-y". Avoid the CRUD pattern</p>
							<p>Our data should not just continue to be a representation of our databases/rest apis have</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Think in graphs</h2>
						<img data-src="./images/core-entities.png" class="stretch">
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>We must intentionally design schemas in an abstract, demand-oriented way</p>
							<p>Think more like the client. How do these pieces of data fit together in the real world?</p>
							<p>How does the client want to interact with us?</p>
							<a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/graphql/ddd/schema-design/">Domain driven design</a>
							<p>This is a start on these for our organization.</p>
							<p>As we keep expanding out we can keep extending and defining the relationships between our data</p>
							<p>But the subteam most familiar with that domain owns their own subgraph</p>
							<p>Evolution of the graph is a feature, not a bug</p>

						<h2>How can we harness this better?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>"Think in graphs"</li>
							<li class="fragment">Conventions and standards</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<h3>Conventions and standards</h3>
							<p>Linting, naming conventions, philosophy on nullability, abstract types, deprecation strategies</p>
							<p>How do we name our queries/entities and what patterns do we follow for update mutations</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Mutations</h3>
						<pre>
							<code class="language-graphql" data-trim>
input UpdateVehicleInformationInput {
	vehicleName: string
	drivers: [Driver!]
	assetGroups: [AssetGroup!]
}

type Mutation {
	updateVehicleInformation($newData: UpdateVehicleInformationInput!) updateVehiclePayload!
}

							</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Here's a simple example of how a lot of our mutations look today</p>
							<p>We create loose inputs with nullable fields and essentially imitate patch endpoints for updating and interacting with our data</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre>
							<code class="language-graphql" data-trim>
input TransferOrganisationInput {
	vehicle: ID!
	assetGroups: ID!
}

input SetVehicleNameInput {
	vehicleID: ID!
	name: String!
}

type Mutation {
	addVehicleToAssetGroup(input: TransferOrganisationInput!) AddVehicleToAssetGroupPayload!
	removeVehicleFromAssetGroup(input: TransferOrganisationInput!) RemoveVehicleFromAssetGroupPayload!
	setVehicleName(input: SetVehicleNameInput!) Vehicle!
}
							</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>What if we flipped that convention and thought about the interactions we are having first?</li>
								<li>We should offer really specific endpoints for partial updates. And reduce our reliance on non-nullable fields</li>
								<li>Remember, you can send multiple mutations in the same request</li>
								<li>Reduce the amount of logic we need on the client. Have the schema clearly tell us what is possible and how to do it.</li>
							</ul>

					<section>
						<pre>
							<code class="language-graphql">
query getAccountCurrentUser($vin: String!){
	canAssignRole
	dueForInsuranceRenewal
}
							</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>We can also do this on the querying side</li>
								<li>What if we moved the logic for things to the server side?</li>
								<li>Teams can define related logic in their own subgraphs by extending user</li>
								<li>But keeping all the ownership of that logic with the domain experts</li>
								<li>Now anywhere in the UI where we are trying to make decisions based on permissions or some business logic, we don't need to keep it on the client side across multiple micro apps</li>
								<li>And the schema is telling us what we know about our data</li>

							<p>We get the raw data for the most part, and each place in the UI that we use a hotel listing, we need to piece together the business logic</p>
							<p>What if what we returned was essentially just the props for our component?</p>
							<p>What if within our subgraph we baked in internationalisation, we distill the raw data into what message we want to give to the user</p>

							This is the pretty future that we are hoping for.
							And while GraphQL offers the promise of taking a client-driven approach to API design and development, it provides no inherent guarantee that any given schema will lend itself to real client use cases.
